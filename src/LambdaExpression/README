The syntax of a lambda expression is:
(parameters) -> expression

Or (parameters) -> { statements; }


Key Points
Lambda expressions work only with functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method).
They improve code readability and reduce boilerplate code.
Common functional interfaces include Runnable, Callable, Comparator, Function, Predicate, etc.
